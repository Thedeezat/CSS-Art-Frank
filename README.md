<img width="1439" alt="frank" src="https://github.com/Thedeezat/CSS-Art-Frank/assets/73987226/c477fbac-627a-4b15-9d96-510f79fb708c">

# About the Project

In this project, I've used the power of CSS to craft an artistic representation of Frank entirely through code. 
By carefully combining CSS properties and utilizing various shapes and gradients, I've managed to capture the essence 
of Frank's character, right down to his expressive facial features and skin color.

# Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
